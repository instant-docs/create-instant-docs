# What is Node.js?

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. It's built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and it uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model which makes it lightweight and efficient.

### Key Features:
- **Event-Driven Model:** Node.js uses events to handle requests asynchronously, making it fast and scalable.
- **Single Threaded but Highly Concurrent:** It can handle multiple connections simultaneously with a single thread, thanks to its non-blocking I/O operations.
- **Wide Range of Packages:** With npm (Node Package Manager), you have access to millions of reusable packages to speed up development.
